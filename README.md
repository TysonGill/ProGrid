# ProGrid
ProGrid is a high-speed grid component with a large number of unique features. It is written entirely using low level graphics primitives. Although highly customizable, ProGrid is very smart and it allows you to offer a fast, high-capacity, pro-level, full-featured grid with just one line of code:

ProGrid.GridDisplay(DataTable)

Features include:

1. Fast and easy loading, dynamic or query-based.
2. Built-in editing, formatting styles, and input validation options.
3. Built-in search, multicolumn sort, copy, print, and export.
4. Flip between standard horizontal grid and vertical (property) display modes.
5. Definable buttons.
6. Lots more.

Feel free to use the grid in your own projects. Although I've used it in innumerable projects over the last 10 years or more and have never needed anything more, I'm always open to collaboration on enhancemements!
