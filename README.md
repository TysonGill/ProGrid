# ProGrid
ProGrid is a high-speed native grid component with a large number of unique features. You can write a full-featured grid program with just one line of code:

ProGrid.GridDisplay(DataTable)

Features include:

1. Fast and easy loading, dynamic or query-based.
2. Built-in editing, formatting styles, and input validation options.
3. Built-in search, multicolumn sort, copy, print, and export.
4. Flip between standard horizontal grid and vertical (property) display modes.
5. Definable buttons.
6. Lots more.

Feel free to use the grid in your own projects. Although I've used it in innumerable projects over the last 10 years or more and have never needed anything more, I'm always open to collaboration on enhancemements!
